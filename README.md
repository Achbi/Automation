A complete B2C SaaS application that allows users to build powerful automation workflows, connecting their favorite apps like Google Drive, Slack, Discord, and Notion.

What makes this project unique? **All third-party connections were built from scratch!** üòâ We intentionally avoided pre-built integration libraries to demonstrate the deep engineering required to handle OAuth, webhooks, and API interactions in a real-world product.
